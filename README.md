My ZSH Prompt
=============

## Timings
There are currently two files in the `test/` directory.

 * `benchmark-variable-assignments.zsh`: This file is used to benchmark how long it takes to assign different variables.
 * `show-prompt-render-times.zsh`: This will show the prompt render times in nanoseconds. It shows the total render times and also breaks it down by the actual prompt render time and the `precmd` time.
